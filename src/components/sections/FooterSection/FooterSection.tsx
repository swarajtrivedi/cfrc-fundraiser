                  Human T-cell Leukemia Virus (HTLV) is a retrovirus that can cause
                  serious conditions including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and
                  HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a
                  debilitating neurological disease. ATLL is one of the most aggressive
                  forms of non hodgkin lymphoma that can be found in the blood as
                  leukemia, lymph nodes as lymphoma, bone, skin, and other areas of the
                  body. It can be presented as Acute Lymphomatous, Chronic and
                  Smoldering with a median survival of 6 months to 2 years. Treatment
                  remains elusive and there is no vaccine or cure for this disease.
